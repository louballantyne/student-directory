# Student Directory #

The **student directory** script allows you to _manage_ the list of students enrolled at the Villains Academy.

## How to use ##
Run directory.rb through the command line.
You'll be given a number of options. Type the number of the option you'd like, or 9 to quit. The program will automatically try to load students in from students.csv. If it is blank, you can create this by inputting students, then saving to file.

## Getting started ##
git clone git@github.com:louballantyne/student-directory.git
